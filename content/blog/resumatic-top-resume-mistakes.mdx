# 5 Common Resume Mistakes Nigerian Tech Grads Make (And How AI Fixes Them)

Let’s face it writing a resume is hard.

Especially when you're just starting out. Whether you're a fresh graduate from ABU, OAU, UNILORIN, or just wrapped up your 3MTT training, your resume is your first impression. Unfortunately, that impression is often… not great.

Most Nigerian tech job seekers don’t lose out because they lack skill they lose out because they fail to **present** those skills effectively.

Here are 5 common resume mistakes (yes, you’re probably making some of them), and how **resuMatic**, our AI-powered resume builder, helps you fix them instantly.

---

## ❌ Mistake #1: Listing Courses Instead of Projects

> "Coursework: Java, Python, Web Dev, Computer Architecture"

This doesn’t tell a recruiter anything real. Everyone in your department took that course. What *did you build*? What did you *learn* that’s relevant?

### ✅ Fix it with resuMatic:
Just describe your project or internship, and resuMatic turns it into a strong, results-driven bullet point:
> "Developed a school result management system using React and Firebase as part of final year project, supporting 200+ students."

---

## ❌ Mistake #2: Using the Same Resume for Every Job

Most students submit one generic CV to every company. But different roles look for different skills.

### ✅ Fix it with resuMatic:
Paste the job description into resuMatic and get an AI-personalized CV tailored to that specific role whether it's for frontend, backend, devops, or data roles.

---

## ❌ Mistake #3: Long, Wordy CVs with No Impact

You only have **6–8 seconds** to grab attention. If your CV is full of fluff like:
> “I am a highly motivated, hardworking individual who enjoys teamwork…”

You’ve already lost the recruiter.

### ✅ Fix it with resuMatic:
We focus on **results and relevance**. No buzzwords. Just clean, impactful statements like:
> "Contributed to a 3-person team that built and deployed a mobile expense tracker app using Flutter."

---

## ❌ Mistake #4: Unreadable Formats That Fail ATS Scans

Most large companies (even in Nigeria) use **Applicant Tracking Systems** to screen resumes. If yours has too many tables, images, or fancy fonts, it’ll never reach a human.

### ✅ Fix it with resuMatic:
All resuMatic resumes are ATS-optimized by default. Simple, scannable, and clean so your CV gets seen *first*.

---

## ❌ Mistake #5: No Links to Proof of Work

> "Built a website"
Okay… but where’s the link?

### ✅ Fix it with resuMatic:
Easily add links to:
- GitHub repos
- Netlify/Vercel live demos
- Your LinkedIn or portfolio

We help you embed clickable links directly into each job or project entry.
