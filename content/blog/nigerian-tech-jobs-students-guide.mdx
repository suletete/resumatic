# Breaking Into Nigeria's Tech Scene in 2025

*A Practical Guide for Students and New Grads*

Nigeria’s tech industry is booming but so is the competition.

With thousands of new tech graduates from universities like UNILAG, FUTA, ABU, UNN, and Covenant every year, and many self-taught devs entering the market, it’s no longer enough to just know HTML or Python. Recruiters want proof of real skills, projects that solve problems, and resumes that clearly tell your story.

That's where this guide comes in. Whether you're a final-year student or just completed a tech training like 3MTT, here's how to position yourself in Nigeria’s evolving job market and how **resuMatic** can help you stand out.

## The Hiring Environment in Nigeria, 2025

Nigeria's tech job market has grown fast, thanks to:
- The rise of **startups** like Flutterwave, Paystack, and Moniepoint
- International remote jobs via platforms like Turing, Deel, and RemoteOK
- Government and private support through programs like 3MTT, NITDA trainings, and ALX

But here’s the hard truth: for every one job, there are **dozens of applicants**. And most hiring managers don’t read every CV they skim and filter, often using ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).

You need to show **proof of work** and deliver a **clean, tailored CV** that passes digital filters and human judgment.

## 1. Internships: Your First Real Foot in the Door

In Nigeria, internships are more than a school requirement they're a strategic edge. Whether it's a SIWES placement, an internship at a local startup, or remote work for a foreign company, you need **real-world exposure**.

Don’t wait for opportunities to come to you:
- Apply directly via LinkedIn, MyJobMag, Jobberman
- Use tech-specific platforms like **Techcabal Job Board**, **Remote Africa**, or **Gigson**
- Network through WhatsApp communities and Twitter spaces like #DevCareers and #TechTwitterNG

And if no one hires you? Hire yourself.
- Build a mini SaaS app for Nigerian students
- Contribute to open source (even just documentation)
- Volunteer for a local NGO needing a website or dashboard

---

## 2. Where to Actually Find Tech Jobs in Nigeria

Here are your best bets in 2025:

- **LinkedIn Nigeria**: Use filters like “Remote” and “Entry-Level”
- **MyJobMag**: Popular for internships and junior roles
- **Jobberman**: Large general board, occasionally tech-focused
- **Gigson**, **Sidebrief**, **Remote Africa**: Tech-heavy, sometimes remote-friendly
- **WhatsApp job boards**: Join alumni groups or niche job channels

Also: don’t forget hackathons, fellowships, and bootcamps like Decagon, Ingressive, She Code Africa, or HNGi.

## 3. Why Most CVs Don’t Work (and How to Fix Yours)

Let’s be real: many Nigerian students use the same template over and over.

> Too generic. Too long. Too outdated.

Most CVs fail because they:
- List courses instead of projects
- Mention buzzwords without proof (e.g., “Hardworking, team player”)
- Include irrelevant skills (e.g., “MS Word”)

**A winning resume in 2025 Nigeria should:**
- Focus on **outcomes**: “Built a result checker app used by 800+ students”
- Be **1 page**, unless you're experienced
- Pass ATS filters: no fancy tables or graphics
- Show **real work**: GitHub, Netlify, or screenshots of live projects

💡 **resuMatic** helps by:
- Auto-generating tailored bullet points using AI
- Highlighting only the skills relevant to each job
- Matching your experience with keywords from Nigerian job listings

## 4. Building a Nigerian Portfolio That Shows You’re Serious

Projects matter more than paper.

Create projects that solve **local problems**:
- A price checker for Jumia/Konga
- A voice-controlled app for Yoruba/Igbo speakers
- A budgeting tool for Nigerian students

Then, deploy them:
- Use **Netlify** or **Vercel** (free)
- Put on **GitHub** and write a good README
- Post on **LinkedIn** with the hashtags: #3MTT, #NaijaDev, #BuildInPublic

Add links directly to your CV and LinkedIn. Don't just say "I'm a developer" **prove it**.

---

## 5. Stand Out With Smart, AI-Optimized Resumes

Many Nigerian employers now use **ATS filters** especially larger firms and international recruiters.

So how do you stand out?

With a resume that:
- Uses **Nigerian job keywords** (e.g., “NYSC-compliant”, “remote-ready”, “agile team”)
- Aligns with **job descriptions** (resuMatic lets you paste the JD and matches it automatically)
- Passes basic parsing tools (no images or multiple columns)

**resuMatic** was built for Nigerian students, interns, and bootcamp grads to create powerful, clean, ATS-friendly resumes in minutes whether you’re applying to Flutterwave or a UK startup via Deel.

---

## Final Words: You Don’t Need 100 Offers

You need **one good one** to start.

Start small. Apply smart. Improve monthly. Whether it's a 3-month internship or freelance gig, the key is to learn, build, and show up consistently. Use smart tools like **resuMatic** to save time and focus your energy on the right opportunities.

> 2025 is your year. Just make sure your resume says so.
